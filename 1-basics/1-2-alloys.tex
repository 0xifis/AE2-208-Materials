Alloys are mixtures of 2 or more elements. These mixtures usually form solid solutions in metals that are stronger than pure metals due to the solid-solution strengthening effect..

There are 2 types of solid solutions - substitutional and interstitial
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Interstitial - smaller solute atoms (ie. carbon, boron and gases) sit within the gaps of the host atom lattice
  \item Substitutional - similar sized atoms (ie. brass, cupronickel) replace host atoms
\end{enumerate}

There are also different types of substitutional solid solutions based on neighbour preferences -
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No preference - Random
  \item A prefers B - Ordered
  \item A prefers A - Clustered
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solubility Limit} % (fold)
\label{sub:solubility_limit}
 When the solubility limit is exceeded, the solute will precipitate out as another solution (ie. 1 random solution and 1 ordered compound).

For instance, when $Al$ and $Cu$ are alloyed together, when $Cu$ exceeds the solubility limit, the compound $CuAl_2$.
