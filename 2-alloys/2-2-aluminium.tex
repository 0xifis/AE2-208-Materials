\subsection{Duralumin ($Al_4Cu$)} % (fold)
\label{sub:duralumins}

Duralumin is an aluminium alloy containing \wtcu{4}.

\cimg{duralumins}

Just like with steel (size of cementite precipitate), the rate of cooling affects the size of the $Cu_2Al$ precipitate.

\subsubsection{Cooled Too Slowly} % (fold)
\label{ssub:cooled_too_slowly}

\begin{itemize}
  \item driving force for the precipitation of $CuAl_2$ rate of nucleation are too small
  \item large, spaced-apart precipitates are formed
  \item moving dislocations can easily avoid the precipitates
  \item final alloy will be soft
\end{itemize}
% subsubsection cooled_too_slowly (end)

\subsubsection{Cool Too Fast} % (fold)
\label{ssub:cool_too_fast}

\begin{itemize}
  \item miss the nose of the TTT curve
  \item $Cu_Al2$ precipitate is not formed
\end{itemize}
% subsubsection cool_too_fast (end)

\subsubsection{Optimal Cooling Rate} % (fold)
\label{ssub:optimal_cooling_rate}


Hence, a controlled cooling rate is required to get
\begin{enumerate}
  \item fine-scaled precipitates of $Cu_Al2$
  \item distributed evenly throughout the $\alpha$-Al grains
\end{enumerate}

\cimg{alum_cooling}

\cimg{alum_ttt}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item After solidification, the alloy is held just below the eutectic temperature,$~550 \degree C$, to allow the solid solution to homogenise.
  \item From $550 \degree C$, Aluminium is quenched rapidly down (miss nose of TTT) to room temperature. 
  \item Reheated and held at $150 \degree C$ for 100 hours to allow $Cu$ atoms from the supersaturated $\alpha$ grains to form fine $CuAl_2$ precipitates.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ageing Process} % (fold)

\subsubsection{0: Super Saturated Solid Solution} % (fold)
\label{ssub:solid_solution}

\cimg[200pt]{ageing_1}


\begin{itemize}
  \item At the start of ageing the alloy is a supersaturated solid solution (substitutional) of homogeneously distributed $Cu$ atoms.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1: Formation of GP Zones} % (fold)
\label{ssub:gp_zones}

\cimg[200pt]{ageing_2}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $Cu$ atoms dissolve as interstitial solute particles between $Al$ atoms and nucleate homogeneously to form disc-shaped 'Guinier-Preston' zones.
\end{itemize}

% subsubsection gp_zones (end)

\subsubsection{3: Growth of GP Zones} % (fold)
\label{ssub:growth_of_gp_zones}

\cimg[200pt]{ageing_3}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Some GP zones grow to form nucleation sites for metastable phase, $\theta''$.
  \item The remaining GP zones dissolve and transfer $Cu$ to the growing $\theta''$ phase through diffusion.
  \item Although, $\theta''$ disc faces are coherent with the Al-matrix, the disc edges create large coherency strains.
\end{itemize}

% subsubsection growth_of_gp_zones (end)

\subsubsection{3: Formation of $\theta'$ Phase} % (fold)
\label{ssub:formation_of_thata}

\cimg[200pt]{ageing_4}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Another metastable phase, $\theta'$, nucleate at matrix dislocations at the expense of $\theta''$
  \item The  remaining $\theta''$ precipitates all dissolve and transfer $Cu$ to the growing  $\theta'$.
  \item Now the disc faces are still perfectly coherent with the matrix but the disc edges are now \textbf{incoherent}. Thus, neither faces nor edges show coherency strain.
\end{itemize}

% subsubsection formation_of_theta (end)

\subsubsection{4: Formation of equilibrium phase, $\theta$} % (fold)
\label{ssub:formation_of_equilibrium_phase_}

\cimg[200pt]{ageing_5}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Equilibrium $CuAl_2$ ($\theta$) nucleates at grain boundaries and at  $\theta'$–matrix interfaces.
  \item The  remaining $\theta'$ precipitates all dissolve and transfer $Cu$ to the growing $\theta$ phase through diffusion.
  \item The $\theta$ phase has very different lattice parameters and is completely incoherent with the $\alpha$ matrix.
  \item Hence, it forms a rounded shape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ageing Strengthening Mechanisms} % (fold)
\label{sub:ageing_strengthening_mechanisms}


\cimg[250pt]{ageing_strength}

During the ageing process, 3 different strengthening mechanisms increase the $\sigma_y$ of the alloy.

\subsubsection{Solution Hardening} % (fold)
\label{ssub:solution_hardening}
At the start of ageing the alloy is mostly strengthened by the \wtcu{4} that is trapped in the supersaturated solution. But when the GP zones form, almost all of the Cu is removed from solution and the solution strengthening virtually disappears 
% subsubsection solution_hardening (end)

\subsubsection{Coherency Stress Hardening} % (fold)
\label{ssub:coherency_stress_hardening}
The coherency strains around the GP zones and $\theta''$ precipitates generate stresses that help prevent dislocation movement. The GP zones give the larger hardening effect

% subsubsection coherency_stress_hardening (end)

\subsubsection{Precipitation Hardening} % (fold)
\label{ssub:precipitation_hardening}
The precipitates can obstruct the dislocations directly. But their effectiveness is limited by two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Cutting} - Resistance to cutting depends on a few factors, including shearing resistance of the precipitate lattice. \textbf{The cutting stress increases with ageing time.}
  \item \textbf{Bowing} - Bowing is easier when the precipitates are far apart. During ageing the precipitate spacing increases from $10nm$ to $1\mu m$ and beyond. \textbf{The bowing stress therefore decreases with ageing time.}
\end{enumerate}

% subsubsection precipitation_hardening (end)
% subsection ageing_strengthening_mechanisms (end)

\subsection{Peak Strength} % (fold)
\label{sub:peak_strength}

Peak strength occurs when ageing stops at the $\theta''$ stage. This gives numerous, closely spaced $~100nm$ particles throughout the $\alpha$ phase.

\subsection{Interesting Alloy Series} % (fold)
\label{sub:interesting_alloy_series}

\subsubsection{7xxx Series} % (fold)
\label{ssub:7xxx_series}

Based on Al-Zn-Mg(-Cu). Highest strength Al alloy on market.

Interesting reactions occur at lower temperatures - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solution treatment - $360\degree C$ ($550\degree C$ for 2xxx)
  \item Ageing treatment - $120\degree C$ ($160\degree C$ for 2xxx)
\end{itemize}

% subsubsection 7xxx_series (end)

\subsubsection{8xxx Series} % (fold)
\label{ssub:8xxx_series}

Based on Al-Li(-Cu-Mg-Zr).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lower density - (3\% per wt\%Li)
  \item Lithium can increase the stiffness of Al-Li alloys 
  \item Li atoms give good solid solution strengthening in Al lattice
\end{itemize}
But
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2-3 times higher cost than other Al alloys
  \item The $\delta’$ phase is not an excellent strengthener.
  \item Li is highly reactive and has much lower density than Al, making casting difficult
\end{itemize}
